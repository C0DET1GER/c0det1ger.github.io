Then I spent like 40 minutes on trying some random greedy that did not work. Then I decided to go look at the other problems.</p><p>First p1. I looked at the subtasks and thought that it could do with sqrt and wrote some kind of Nsqrt(N)log^2(N)-ish solution (I thought that there’s only one log because I suck at time complexity, which was also why I decided to implement it). It only failed three testcases. I moved on because three testcases didn’t really seem to matter right now.</p><p>This was about at the 1 hour mark since I passed (most of) p1 relatively quickly. Then I looked at p2 and had no idea. I thought of dp for subtask 2 but nothing beyond that. I decided that “p3 must actually be very easy” and put 2 more additional hours on that problem. I just started having random ideas and found out that greedy actually worked. It’s a rather short implementation so I ACed the problem at around the 3 hour mark.</p><p>At this time my score was about 600, and I figured that the 3 testcases might actually matter. (At this point I still didn’t notice that my time complexity had two logs) I thought that it must’ve been a constant problem, so I removed the “define int long long” and other unnecessary code to pass all testcases.</p><p>I had 666 points, and since p1 and p3 seemed to be relatively easy (although I had a skill issue and spent 3 hours on them), I thought the cutoff would be around 800. This also meant that I would have to solve subtask 3 in the remaining hour. This didn’t seem too bad, but I thought I should solve subtasks 1 and 2 first to secure a score above 700. Then, since I had a significant skill issue I spent about 30 minutes to solve those subtasks after I had the idea for dp (the main thing was that my solution was different and implementation heavy I guess).</p><p>Then I just spent the remaining 30 minutes thinking about how to solve subtask 3 and not solving it (which is essentially doing nothing)</p><p>After the contest, people seem to say that the cutoff will be around 750. I hope that the cutoff is 700, although it seems realistically impossible ngl. </p><p>Still hope that the cutoff is 700 (or lower) <span class="github-emoji"><span>🥺</span><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f97a.png?v8" aria-hidden="true" onerror="this.parent.classList.add('github-emoji-fallback')"></span> I still want a chance to camp in 9th grade, even if it’s 0.000000001%</p><p>I also learned that I’m not the only CF master clowning in USACO gold</p>]]></content>

I also barely share studies with people in my homeroom.</p><p>Another thing is that our male-female ratio is like 1:2, and I’m not the type of person that talks with girls a lot, which makes things even worse.</p><p>Other classes are much better though than homeroom imo, at least I talk to people.</p><h2 id="CP"><a href="#CP" class="headerlink" title="CP"></a>CP</h2><p>I didn’t really do CP a lot this quarter, I guess I will fall back to specialist on CF soon.</p><p>I haven’t really done any contests recently after I reached master, maybe just one AtCoder contest and an HSCSA contest. I feel I should practice more OI though, I haven’t practiced a lot and will probably throw OI contests for not getting any partials.</p><p>Also LIT is currently in<del>de</del>finitely postponed, so I might fail my C1 goal miserably <span class="github-emoji"><span>🤡</span><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f921.png?v8" aria-hidden="true" onerror="this.parent.classList.add('github-emoji-fallback')"></span> Hopefully it will eventually happen, although I might still not get first in middle school division because I’m bad.</p><h2 id="Academics"><a href="#Academics" class="headerlink" title="Academics"></a>Academics</h2><p>Not too bad I guess.</p><p>In the beginning my grades were bad for Earth Science but it went back up later after all the tests and other stuff. On the contrary, my humanities (Literature + Social Studies) grades gradually dropped as the quarter passed. At least I successfully kept my GPA above 4. </p><p>Current GPA: 4.13, might still change though since grades are not final until like 11/18. I’m pretty glad that my teachers aren’t too harsh on grading.</p><h2 id="Math"><a href="#Math" class="headerlink" title="Math"></a>Math</h2><p>I feel there’s much more math contests here, and math team people are very orz. </p><p>A good thing about LHS I guess is that there’s a lot of orz people and I can learn from them instead of having to do everything myself. Also that I can be carried in contests like HMMT which feels very nice.</p><p>The tryouts went out nicely for me, at least I didn’t silly too much, which placed me in teams that may be higher than my capability. I’ll try my best not to do nothing I guess.</p><p>I originally thought that math team had meetings too often, but because of the half days and all the breaks it turns out not to be that many.</p><p>And I kind of stopped doing OTIS after school started which is bad, I’ve completed 2 units after the summer break and only 2 units after school started. I’m currently like level 31 and I don’t know how good that is.</p><hr><p><del>btw I’m not trying to say anything is a scam or something</del></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>yayy</p><span id="more"></span><p>I’m in Lex Gamma, and I’m probably the only person in the team (or maybe among everyone in LHS that came to HMMT this year) that has never competed in HMMT. Everyone in the team is way better than me tho, so I’m ready to be carried in team and guts round and drag the team down in individual rounds.</p><h2 id="General-Round"><a href="#General-Round" class="headerlink" title="General Round"></a>General Round</h2><p>I did problems 1-6 and 8 and didn’t even look at the other problems. They announced the answers right after the test ended and I got 3 and 6 wrong which is like sad. I felt soo good when I remembered about the “15” case for problem 6 and thought that many people would probably forget about that one, but turned out that I forgot about the 195 case so I was like one off. I wouldn’t call that a silly though, as it’s my own skill issue, but I probably lost like 6 points because of this. At least I found the right pattern in problem 8 which is not too bad.</p><h2 id="Theme-Round"><a href="#Theme-Round" class="headerlink" title="Theme Round"></a>Theme Round</h2><p>0 sillies in this round, but still bad</p><p>I only looked at 1-7, and 9 (because it’s combo) and didn’t know how to do 6 because I’m bad at geo. Turned out I spent too much time on 9, and didn’t really do it the right way. Although I solved 6 problems my distrib is like very bad, so I’m probably the lowest in the team.</p><h2 id="Team-Round"><a href="#Team-Round" class="headerlink" title="Team Round"></a>Team Round</h2><p>tnag carry orz</p><p>I probably didn’t do anything, except p1 p4 and maybe p8, which other teammates could probably have done quickly without me. We (tnag) also perfed teamround with like 5 or 10 minutes left which was nice. We ended up turning it in 30 seconds early maybe for bragging purposes, idk</p><p>And they posted the solutions on the HMMT website immediately after the teamround ended, and we ended up not sillying anything and getting a perfect score, tnag orz</p><h2 id="Guts-Round"><a href="#Guts-Round" class="headerlink" title="Guts Round"></a>Guts Round</h2><p>alright this is when I really did absolutely nothing</p><p>We started pretty good in the first seven sets (perfect score on each), but we were a bit slow so we had to rush through the rest of the sets and unfortunately got 0 points in estimation. Still rank 10 which is like good compared to our scores in individual rounds lol.</p><h2 id="Other"><a href="#Other" class="headerlink" title="Other"></a>Other</h2><p>tnag went to int bee finals, tnag orz</p><p>I also went to both Friday night and the Sunday lectures because it’s my first time. On Friday I went to HackHMMT and unexpectedly met CorzdeTiger and Sunday stuff were interesting I guess? </p><h2 id="Estimates"><a href="#Estimates" class="headerlink" title="Estimates"></a>Estimates</h2><p>G 21.153, T 23.242, Total 44.395<br>G rk. 60, T rk. 60, Total rk. 70<br>I sold so bad :(<br>Let’s see how good an estimate of my score this is. I probably failed the M2 goal miserably</p><h2 id="Aftermath"><a href="#Aftermath" class="headerlink" title="Aftermath"></a>Aftermath</h2><p>I turned out to be not too bad at predicting?</p><p>Results:<br>G 20.153, T 24.242, Total 44.395<br>G rk. 89, T rk. 44, Total rk. 65</p><p>Kinda happy that I did have something in top 50 but also kinda sad for being that close to top 50 in general and overall (well it’s not actually that close, but I just felt I was so dumb for forgetting about the 195 case)</p><p>At least I’ve finally achieved one of my goals.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>oops, although I guess it’s not too bad <strong>(LONG RANT WARNING)</strong></p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Before"><a href="#Before" class="headerlink" title="Before"></a>Before</h2><p>I was like kinda nervous, because even though this wasn’t my first time taking the AMCs (actually 10th time), it’s the first time I’m taking it digitally, and I’m afraid that I would mess up. I probably had to be extra careful as I thought it’s easier to misclick something and ruin my entire test.</p><p>Last time I wasn’t rlly satisfied with my score (120 on an extremely easy test), so I don’t want to have bad time management again. I also hope that my AMC10 scores won’t be like my AMC8 ones (strictly decreasing arithmetic sequence). I sillied so bad in the past (4 sillies on AMC8 after reviewing my answers !!!)</p><h2 id="The-test"><a href="#The-test" class="headerlink" title="The test (?)"></a>The test (?)</h2><p>So although I was a bit nervous, I tried to tell myself to stay calm, that there’s always a 10B and I had little chances to get into JMO anyway. Still, I didn’t expect the Commons I (where we took the AMC10 in LHS) to be that crowded, which somehow made me even more anxious.</p><p>I originally wanted to use some kind of strategy like starting from the middle so that I would feel more confident, but then thought that would be worse as I might not even be able to solve those problems :(</p><p>I spent like 2 minutes solving p1 because I was so afraid I might silly the first problem. Then I looked at p2, and this was when all the disaster started.</p><p>I stared at the problem for 1 minute, trying to understand it, and finally understood it. But I was afraid that I would silly on the second problem, so I subtracted the two from each other and was stuck because I thought 300 / 0.3 = 100 <span class="github-emoji"><span>💀</span><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f480.png?v8" aria-hidden="true" onerror="this.parent.classList.add('github-emoji-fallback')"></span></p><p>Then I was stuck for another 5 minutes</p><p>I decided that I shouldn’t be stuck on a problem for too long, so I moved on. But after doing every 5 problems, I was like “it’s impossible that p2 was so hard” and went back to get stuck for another 3 minutes. I felt so desperate when I couldn’t even do problem 2 when I was aiming for DHR, and couldn’t stay calm even though I tried to, until I found out that I solved 16 problems and there was 15 minutes left.</p><p>I briefly counted and found that I could only get a 109.5 (without any sillies), and I might really get a lower score than last year. Based on past experiences, I on average had 3 sillies per AMC, so I might not even make AIME <span class="github-emoji"><span>💀</span><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f480.png?v8" aria-hidden="true" onerror="this.parent.classList.add('github-emoji-fallback')"></span></p><p>I expected myself to panick even more after realizing this, but perhaps it’s that the problems later were easier, I did 18-22 pretty quickly, and also found my mistake in p2. In the last few minutes, I knew that I didn’t really have time to check my answers, so I only made sure that I didn’t click on the wrong option on the computer.</p><h2 id="After"><a href="#After" class="headerlink" title="After"></a>After</h2><p>I didn’t really check my answers with others since the digital version scrambled the questions and answer choices so that it’s harder to cheat (and I didn’t notice for a while). I knew I probably got a really bad score, considering that I could easily calculate wrong when I’m nervous. Anyways there’s still a B so hopefully I get a better score on that one :&lt;</p><p>===== Above was written before I knew the answers (and scores) =====</p><p>So turns out that I didn’t have any sillies, giving me a 136.5 (18 higher than expected). It’s still not a very good score considering people saying that this year’s test was also easy like last year, but enough to make me happy I guess. This is probably my first AMC without sillies, which is ironic as people on AoPS said that this was the most silliable test ever.</p><p>My distrib: 11111 11111 11111 11111 11bbb</p><p>By this time I’ve also finished taking 10B but I probably won’t write a blog about it because I’m lazy and I did very bad despite it’s much easier than 10A imo.</p><p>Hopefully 136.5 is enough to get DHR, MAA didn’t release the statistics this time so I dont really know, sad.</p>]]></content>
