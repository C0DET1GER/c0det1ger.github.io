The trip was a fun experience overall (this was actually the first travel competition I‚Äôve ever attended). On Friday our plane got delayed so we had lunch at like 4. Then we went to play frisbee and later went to estimathon (we won!). </p><p>The Theoretical Computer Science round was kind of interesting because I‚Äôve never done one of these rounds before (except for practicing in math team). But it turned out that we didn‚Äôt do too good on that round either despite me being a USACO main. On team the only thing I did was p1 and solving p2 at the last second but not having enough time to change our wrong answer.</p><p>During individuals I ABSOLUTELY SOLD (distribution was strictly less than 434 oops). I probably should‚Äôve been in Lexington Epsilon. I can‚Äôt really say anything though since CMIMC (and perhaps math in general) isn‚Äôt as important as USACO is to me or USA(J)MO is to other people, so I probably shouldn‚Äôt be ranting too much.</p><p>On our way back my seat was changed for some reason, making me sit with a stranger instead of Lexington people. The wifi also didn‚Äôt work on our way back, so I basically just idled for an hour.</p><h2 id="Other"><a href="#Other" class="headerlink" title="Other"></a>Other</h2><p>Obviously my 226.5 JMO index was lower than the 233.5 cutoff, but since I wasn‚Äôt prepared anyway and would spend more time on preparing for USACO, I don‚Äôt really feel too bad about that. I also probably got a 10 in F=ma (got p1, p4, p6, p8, p9, p10, p11, and guessed the rest), which is much lower than a 15 so I don‚Äôt have anything to regret about.</p><p>There was also picoCTF and vyx7 &amp; other LexMACS people admitted orz (33th place in US High School or below). In the beginning of the window I just stole all the easy problems and pretended that I contributed. I‚Äôll (probably) also become one of the LIT organizers which means that I probably can‚Äôt participate in LIT 2024 standard round even if it somehow miraculously happens.</p><p>Unfortunately, my GPA fell off so now I likely won‚Äôt have one higher than 4.1 anymore.</p><p>The only thing I can hope for now is to not do bad in USACO Open, hopefully a 300+ (or even 400+) score. I don‚Äôt want all my luck in December, January and February to be for nothing.</p><p>My birthday also passed recently, so now I‚Äôm 15 years old.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Camp when?</p><span id="more"></span><p>Score: 494, the distribution was 333 / 56 / 105</p><p>The contest went pretty well, perhaps even better than the January contest. I quickly (in the first 30 minutes) got the main observation for problem 1. Although I proceeded to spend 1 hour on implementation, I just felt confident that I could pull a &gt;400 score again with the 2.5 hours remaining.</p><p>So I was pretty calm and relaxed and got 494 with 1 hour remaining. Maybe some parts of me thought this was good enough, while some other parts of me still thought I should try to full solve another problem, since this would probably be enough to make it to the leaderboard.</p><p>I just thought p2 was probably actually easy and it had a lot of subtasks that could hopefully get me to a &gt;500 score so I spent the remaining hour doing p2 and got 0 points. But I guess this was fine since I still don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve gotten p3 anyway.</p><p>I feel the style of platinum contests, or perhaps even gold, have changed a lot. At least noticably there hasn‚Äôt been as much graph problems (0 in plat, not sure how many in gold), and the problems are more ad-hoc in general. Perhaps this benefits me since I‚Äôm probably an ad-hoc main, but this would probably mean that even if I somehow make USACO camp, I would still have to rely on this kind of different style to perform well.</p><p>Hopefully I don‚Äôt throw USACO Open along with my camp chances <span class="github-emoji"><span>üôè</span><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f64f.png?v8" aria-hidden="true" onerror="this.parent.classList.add('github-emoji-fallback')"></span> People say an average of &gt;300 should make but I don‚Äôt know how much more USACO open is weighted so it‚Äôs a little scary.

Last time I got 421, which was apparently a very common score, and it was rank 49. I have no idea how this converts to the rank in the United States (or perhaps if we limit it to certified people).</p><p>Reposting manifold market<br><a href="https://manifold.markets/C0DET1GER/will-i-make-usaco-camp-in-2025?play=true">https://manifold.markets/C0DET1GER/will-i-make-usaco-camp-in-2025?play=true</a></p><p>My manifold net worth tripled in February which was ‚Ä¶ nice?</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>because we had a snow day</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Some-Stuff"><a href="#Some-Stuff" class="headerlink" title="Some Stuff"></a>Some Stuff</h2><p>Originally we were going to take aime i but because of snow day we had to take aime ii. This may be kind of good because historically aime ii has lower cutoffs (and I don‚Äôt feel the tests are harder). But maybe this time cracked regions are taking aime ii which will inflate the cutoffs idk. </p><p>So I had aime ii and f=ma on the same day (f=ma was delayed to like 5:45-7:00), which probably didn‚Äôt make that much of a difference since there‚Äôs no way I could‚Äôve gotten &gt;=14 in f=ma. (I‚Äôm just bad like that)</p><p>I didn‚Äôt really expect anything to be honest. Like of course my goal is to make jmo, but I knew that it‚Äôs not that likely considering how I would‚Äôve thrown both AMCs if not because I was lucky (and still didn‚Äôt get 140+ for AMC 10A, but I guess 136.5 is fine). Also that I haven‚Äôt been doing that much math lately since my main objective is to make usaco camp I guess (impossible)</p><p>In last year‚Äôs aime, I sillied (maybe some of them don‚Äôt really count as sillies) my way from 8 to 5, giving me like a 170 index. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt really expect myself to make jmo, and maybe that turned out to be the right mindset, since I wasn‚Äôt too nervous before / during the test.</p><h2 id="AIME"><a href="#AIME" class="headerlink" title="AIME"></a>AIME</h2><p>For p1, in the beginning my lengths were all wrong because I kept misreading the letters in the lenghts. But at least I finally managed to solve it after like 7 minutes. Then I did p2-4 in the next 15 minutes and found out there‚Äôs two geo in a row.</p><p>I kind of wanted to skip both since I‚Äôm a geo antimain and I didn‚Äôt want the geos to give me emotional damage for the entire test. But then I remembered that it‚Äôs just p5 and p6 which will hopefully not be too hard. So I spent 20 more minutes and did both.</p><p>Then I just kind of skimmed through the next 5 problems and found that 4 / maybe 5 of them were combo which somehow boosted my confidence. And they turned out not to be too hard so I got 7, 8, 9, and 11 in the next 30 minutes or so (I didn‚Äôt know how to p10 because all I could think of was a 16 * 8 * 3 dp skull)</p><p>So now I had 105 minutes left and did 10 problems, but I thought the ten I did were easy so I probably needed more if I wanted to get lucky and make jmo. I didn‚Äôt really spend a lot of time on p12 and p14 because geo. So I started trying to do p13. </p><p>Then I suddenly wanted to go to the bathroom but somehow thought that I had to submit early if I wanted to go so I held it for 30 minutes. Until I figured I should actually ask and turned out I could go without submitting early <span class="github-emoji"><span>üíÄ</span><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f480.png?v8" aria-hidden="true" onerror="this.parent.classList.add('github-emoji-fallback')"></span> (and this submitting early rule probably only applied to my elementary school exams). Going to the bathroom earlier probably wouldn‚Äôt have made a difference though since I was trying to do p13 the entire time.</p><p>I kind of wanted to do more problems, but then thought a 236.5 would likely be enough to qualify for jmo, but that also meant I needed 0 sillies which is impossible. So I went to check my work and caught 4 sillies (p4 multiply by 1/3 instead of 3, p5 I did multiplication wrong, p9‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know what to say it‚Äôs just entirely wrong, and p11 I had 95 because I forgot about numbers that weren‚Äôt divisors of 24)</p><p>This was satisfying, but also extremely terrifying at the same time. This meant my aime score would‚Äôve been like 4 points lower (at least I thought it would be 4 points lower). These 40 minutes of checking really made a big difference.</p><p>Then I proceeded to think about p10 since it‚Äôs the only combo problem left. Got it in about 10 minutes, and I immediately checked and caught a silly. Spent about 5 more minutes and found that I only had 10 minutes left so I couldn‚Äôt really do anything. Well, I checked my work but didn‚Äôt find any more sillies.</p><h2 id="Reflection"><a href="#Reflection" class="headerlink" title="Reflection"></a>Reflection</h2><p>so distribution was like<br>11111 11011 00000 (got p8 and p11 wrong)</p><p>For p8 I forgot that 55 existed so I wrote 800 <span class="github-emoji"><span>üò≠</span><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f62d.png?v8" aria-hidden="true" onerror="this.parent.classList.add('github-emoji-fallback')"></span> I wouldn‚Äôt count that as a silly but idk<br>For p11 I remembered that 8 was 0 the first time but then completely forgot that it was 0 when I was correcting it <span class="github-emoji"><span>üíÄ</span><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f480.png?v8" aria-hidden="true" onerror="this.parent.classList.add('github-emoji-fallback')"></span> </p><p>So my jmo index went from 246.5 to 226.5</p><p>Definitely not optimal, but considering that I didn‚Äôt even anticipate jmo, this was better than I thought. But perhaps qualifying or not wouldn‚Äôt matter that much either, since I‚Äôm bad at proofs and stuff ‚Äì&gt; will probably get like a 0 on jmo anyway <del>and flagged a cheater</del></p><p>And I might‚Äôve been cooked in F=ma, we don‚Äôt talk about that</p>]]></content>

Maybe I just thought I could get lucky like day 1 and get a lot of points by guessing.

Then I spent like 40 minutes on trying some random greedy that did not work. Then I decided to go look at the other problems.</p><p>First p1. I looked at the subtasks and thought that it could do with sqrt and wrote some kind of Nsqrt(N)log^2(N)-ish solution (I thought that there‚Äôs only one log because I suck at time complexity, which was also why I decided to implement it). It only failed three testcases. I moved on because three testcases didn‚Äôt really seem to matter right now.</p><p>This was about at the 1 hour mark since I passed (most of) p1 relatively quickly. Then I looked at p2 and had no idea. I thought of dp for subtask 2 but nothing beyond that. I decided that ‚Äúp3 must actually be very easy‚Äù and put 2 more additional hours on that problem. I just started having random ideas and found out that greedy actually worked. It‚Äôs a rather short implementation so I ACed the problem at around the 3 hour mark.</p><p>At this time my score was about 600, and I figured that the 3 testcases might actually matter. (At this point I still didn‚Äôt notice that my time complexity had two logs) I thought that it must‚Äôve been a constant problem, so I removed the ‚Äúdefine int long long‚Äù and other unnecessary code to pass all testcases.</p><p>I had 666 points, and since p1 and p3 seemed to be relatively easy (although I had a skill issue and spent 3 hours on them), I thought the cutoff would be around 800. This also meant that I would have to solve subtask 3 in the remaining hour. This didn‚Äôt seem too bad, but I thought I should solve subtasks 1 and 2 first to secure a score above 700. Then, since I had a significant skill issue I spent about 30 minutes to solve those subtasks after I had the idea for dp (the main thing was that my solution was different and implementation heavy I guess).</p><p>Then I just spent the remaining 30 minutes thinking about how to solve subtask 3 and not solving it (which is essentially doing nothing)</p><p>After the contest, people seem to say that the cutoff will be around 750. I hope that the cutoff is 700, although it seems realistically impossible ngl. </p><p>Still hope that the cutoff is 700 (or lower) <span class="github-emoji"><span>ü•∫</span><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f97a.png?v8" aria-hidden="true" onerror="this.parent.classList.add('github-emoji-fallback')"></span> I still want a chance to camp in 9th grade, even if it‚Äôs 0.000000001%</p><p>I also learned that I‚Äôm not the only CF master clowning in USACO gold</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>oops, although I guess it‚Äôs not too bad <strong>(LONG RANT WARNING)</strong></p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Before"><a href="#Before" class="headerlink" title="Before"></a>Before</h2><p>I was like kinda nervous, because even though this wasn‚Äôt my first time taking the AMCs (actually 10th time), it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôm taking it digitally, and I‚Äôm afraid that I would mess up. I probably had to be extra careful as I thought it‚Äôs easier to misclick something and ruin my entire test.</p><p>Last time I wasn‚Äôt rlly satisfied with my score (120 on an extremely easy test), so I don‚Äôt want to have bad time management again. I also hope that my AMC10 scores won‚Äôt be like my AMC8 ones (strictly decreasing arithmetic sequence). I sillied so bad in the past (4 sillies on AMC8 after reviewing my answers !!!)</p><h2 id="The-test"><a href="#The-test" class="headerlink" title="The test (?)"></a>The test (?)</h2><p>So although I was a bit nervous, I tried to tell myself to stay calm, that there‚Äôs always a 10B and I had little chances to get into JMO anyway. Still, I didn‚Äôt expect the Commons I (where we took the AMC10 in LHS) to be that crowded, which somehow made me even more anxious.</p><p>I originally wanted to use some kind of strategy like starting from the middle so that I would feel more confident, but then thought that would be worse as I might not even be able to solve those problems :(</p><p>I spent like 2 minutes solving p1 because I was so afraid I might silly the first problem. Then I looked at p2, and this was when all the disaster started.</p><p>I stared at the problem for 1 minute, trying to understand it, and finally understood it. But I was afraid that I would silly on the second problem, so I subtracted the two from each other and was stuck because I thought 300 / 0.3 = 100 <span class="github-emoji"><span>üíÄ</span><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f480.png?v8" aria-hidden="true" onerror="this.parent.classList.add('github-emoji-fallback')"></span></p><p>Then I was stuck for another 5 minutes</p><p>I decided that I shouldn‚Äôt be stuck on a problem for too long, so I moved on. But after doing every 5 problems, I was like ‚Äúit‚Äôs impossible that p2 was so hard‚Äù and went back to get stuck for another 3 minutes. I felt so desperate when I couldn‚Äôt even do problem 2 when I was aiming for DHR, and couldn‚Äôt stay calm even though I tried to, until I found out that I solved 16 problems and there was 15 minutes left.</p><p>I briefly counted and found that I could only get a 109.5 (without any sillies), and I might really get a lower score than last year. Based on past experiences, I on average had 3 sillies per AMC, so I might not even make AIME <span class="github-emoji"><span>üíÄ</span><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f480.png?v8" aria-hidden="true" onerror="this.parent.classList.add('github-emoji-fallback')"></span></p><p>I expected myself to panick even more after realizing this, but perhaps it‚Äôs that the problems later were easier, I did 18-22 pretty quickly, and also found my mistake in p2. In the last few minutes, I knew that I didn‚Äôt really have time to check my answers, so I only made sure that I didn‚Äôt click on the wrong option on the computer.</p><h2 id="After"><a href="#After" class="headerlink" title="After"></a>After</h2><p>I didn‚Äôt really check my answers with others since the digital version scrambled the questions and answer choices so that it‚Äôs harder to cheat (and I didn‚Äôt notice for a while). I knew I probably got a really bad score, considering that I could easily calculate wrong when I‚Äôm nervous. Anyways there‚Äôs still a B so hopefully I get a better score on that one :&lt;</p><p>===== Above was written before I knew the answers (and scores) =====</p><p>So turns out that I didn‚Äôt have any sillies, giving me a 136.5 (18 higher than expected). It‚Äôs still not a very good score considering people saying that this year‚Äôs test was also easy like last year, but enough to make me happy I guess. This is probably my first AMC without sillies, which is ironic as people on AoPS said that this was the most silliable test ever.</p><p>My distrib: 11111 11111 11111 11111 11bbb</p><p>By this time I‚Äôve also finished taking 10B but I probably won‚Äôt write a blog about it because I‚Äôm lazy and I did very bad despite it‚Äôs much easier than 10A imo.</p><p>Hopefully 136.5 is enough to get DHR, MAA didn‚Äôt release the statistics this time so I dont really know, sad.</p>]]></content>
